## How-To

Anyone is free to contribute so long as the contents are specific to Atlanta, GA and the metro area! Zoom/streaming content is fine if it's geared toward Georgia residents. This is a resource guide for finding community and networking opportunities, after all.

<br/>

1. Please put everything in **alphabetical order**
2. Give a brief description of the collection item
3. **_DO NOT_** list tutorials, tools, docs, or podcasts

<br/>

### Add New Catagory:

```markdown
### [<u>Catagory Name</u>](#catagory-name)
```

### Add Content:

```markdown
- [Collection Item Title](https://)
```

### Nest the Description:

```markdown
- [Collection Item Title](https://)
  - Nested description
```
